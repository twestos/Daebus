"""
Daebus Example

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating a Daebus service that uses Redis pub/sub
2. Using DaebusCaller to communicate with Daebus services
3. Multi-step responses for long-running operations
4. Long-running background threads with app.thread
5. Lifecycle hooks with app.on_start()

To run this example:
1. Start the service: python example.py
2. In another terminal, run the client code (uncomment client_example())
